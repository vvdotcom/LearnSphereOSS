DESCRIPTION: ${difficultyConfig.description}

EXAM REQUIREMENTS:
- Number of questions: ANALYZE the uploaded exam to determine appropriate question count (typically 15-25 questions)
- Question types: MATCH the question types found in the uploaded exam (multiple choice, short answer, essay, etc.)
- Time limit: CALCULATE appropriate time based on question count and complexity (typically 1-3 minutes per question)
- Difficulty Level: ${examLevel}/7 (${difficultyConfig.label})

${hasUploadedFiles ? `
CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: Identify all topics, concepts, and subject areas covered in the uploaded exam

DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION STRATEGY:
- Create questions appropriate for Level ${examLevel} difficulty
- Use standard academic question counts (15-25 questions)
- Set appropriate time limits (45-90 minutes typical)
- Include variety of question types (multiple choice, short answer, essay)
- Focus on ${difficultyConfig.cognitiveLevel} cognitive skills
- ${difficultyConfig.complexity}
- Ensure educational value and clear learning objectives

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
- Completed Exams: ${completedExams.length}/${examSeries.totalExams}
- Average Score: ${avgScore}%
- Score Range: ${lowestScore}% - ${highestScore}%
- Average Time: ${Math.floor(avgTime / 60)}:${(avgTime % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0')}

DETAILED PERFORMANCE BY LEVEL:
${performanceData.map(data => `
Level ${data.difficultyLevel} (${data.examTitle}):
- Score: ${data.score}%
- Time: ${Math.floor(data.timeTaken / 60)}:${(data.timeTaken % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0')} / ${Math.floor(data.estimatedTime / 60)}:${(data.estimatedTime % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0')} allocated

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Performance Trends**: Analyze score progression across difficulty levels
2. **Time Management**: Evaluate time efficiency and pacing
3. **Difficulty Adaptation**: How well the student adapts to increasing difficulty
4. **Strengths**: Identify areas of strong performance
5. **Weaknesses**: Pinpoint specific areas needing improvement
6. **Study Strategy**: Recommend specific study approaches
7. **Next Steps**: Suggest which exams to retake or focus on

Provide a comprehensive analysis in the following format:

📊 BASIC PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
- Average Score: ${avgScore}%
- Completed: ${completedExams.length}/${examSeries.totalExams} exams
- Score Range: ${lowestScore}% - ${highestScore}%

💡 GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
${avgScore >= 80 ? '• Excellent performance! Continue with advanced levels.' : 
  avgScore >= 70 ? '• Good progress! Focus on reviewing missed concepts.' :
  '• Consider reviewing fundamental concepts before advancing.'}
${lowestScore < 70 ? '• Retake lower-scoring exams to reinforce learning.' : ''}
${avgTime > 0 && avgTime > (completedExams[0]?.estimatedTime || 60) * 60 ? '• Work on time management and question pacing.' : ''}`;
